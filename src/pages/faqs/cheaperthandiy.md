Yes. The products we use are not available for general public and have to be applied by qualified specialists. There is also a significant difference in the products we use than the proprietary products from garden centres. At best most DIY feeds will last 3 - 4 weeks, whereas our fertilisers will last 10 â€“ 13 weeks and they will not scorch your grass.

Lawns Matter uses the finest professional turf fertilisers to nourish your lawn.  

- These feeds are not available to buy domestically and to get the best results must be applied by a trained professional as they are designed to release fertilisers to the root zones over several weeks.  

- We attend to your lawn once every 10 weeks to carry out lawn treatments, in each season. 

- We notify you in advance of each treatment date and we ensure that we leave your property clean and secure.

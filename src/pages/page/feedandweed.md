Lawns Matter uses the finest professional turf fertilisers to nourish your lawn.  These feeds are not available to buy domestically and are designed to release fertilisers to the root zones over several weeks.  We at your house every 10 weeks to carry out the following lawn treatments, starting with the current season.  You will get notification of each treatment date in advance and we will leave your property clean and secure

Spring 
March - April
Spring is the time when we wake the lawn up from its dormant stage over winter.  We put down a balanced granular fertiliser and will also give it a blanket spray of a herbicide weed killer which will rid weeds or a moss control depending on what it needs.  Its this time of the year where we may recommend having a scarification if required.

Summer  
May to August 
With the growing season now underway we use a slow release fertiliser that will last 10 to 12 weeks which will keep your lawn looking its best.  We then target any weeds using a different herbicide.  We tend to spot spray for weeds this time of the year so we reduce how much herbicide we are using.

Autumn
September to December
This time of the year we want to concentrate on root development so we use a low nitrogen granular fertiliser which will slow down the top growth but focus its energy on the root. We also followup with a spot spray of weed control or if its a lawn that likes to grow moss we will hit it early in the year with a moss control.  We also crack on getting our lawns aerated ready for the harsh winter.

Winter
January to February
Very little growth is happening with the lawn so we focus on moss control.  With the moss control is an organic lawn tonic, seaweed.  Seaweed helps to stimulate the soil bacteria which then helps to reduce thatch.  It also increases resistance to disease such as fusarium and improves the soil

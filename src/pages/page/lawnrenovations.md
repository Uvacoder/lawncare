Our most popular service of 2019 is back for 2020!

If your lawn has gotten out of control and is infested with moss, weeds and
thatch then a lawn renovation is your answer. Lawn renovation basically means we
kill the moss and weeds and then we either turf cut the lawn or scarify it back
to soil and re-seed. The beauty of this treatment is that we can choose the
correct type of grass seed that will thrive in it environment which cannot be
said for turfing which only uses a set species.  
Lawn renovation is also a 1/4 of the price of turfing.

Lawns Matter ensures that our clients lawns receive the best in nutrition by using the finest professional turf fertilisers to nourish your lawn.  

- These feeds are not available to buy domestically and to get the best results must be applied by a trained professional as they are designed to release fertilisers to the root zones over several weeks, provinding nutrition to your lawn for 10 - 13 weeks compared to the 3-4 weeks of feed that is delivered by products that are available to the general public. 

- We typically attend to your lawn once every 10 weeks to carry out lawn treatments. 

- We notify you in advance of each treatment date and we ensure that we leave your property as clean and secure as it was when we arrived.

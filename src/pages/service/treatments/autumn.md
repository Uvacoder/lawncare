* **Autumn (September to December)**
  This time of the year we want to concentrate on root development so we use a low nitrogen granular fertiliser which will slow down the top growth but focus its energy on the root. We also followup with a spot spray of weed control or if its a lawn that likes to grow moss we will hit it early in the year with a moss control.  We also crack on getting our lawns aerated ready for the harsh winter.

* **Winter (January to February)**
  We only apply treatments in winterr when the weather allows. Very little growth is happening with the lawn so we focus on moss control.  With the moss control is an organic lawn tonic, seaweed.  Seaweed helps to stimulate the soil bacteria which then helps to reduce thatch.  It also increases resistance to disease such as fusarium and improves the soil

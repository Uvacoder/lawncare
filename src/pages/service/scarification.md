Scarification is a very important treatment.  It helps to remove the build up thatch and moss in your lawn.  It also helps with getting air and water penetration to the soil, which will allow the grass to thrive more.

Why do i need to scarify?
It will help the health and appearance by removing thatch and moss.  Thatch is a layer of dead organic material which can build up over time above the soil surface.  The thatch can limit water, air and nutrients from getting to the grass roots.  This will mean that your lawn will suffer and will be less drought resistant.  It can also lead to moss building up on top of the thatch layer.  Therefore we do suggest to scarifying once a year to reduce this from happening.

When can we scarify?
The best time is when the lawn is actively growing, therefore, spring and autumn.  Scarifying at other times is not suitable and may cause more damage to your lawn.

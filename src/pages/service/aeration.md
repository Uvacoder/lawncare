Aeration is key to what we do.  If we look after the soil then the rest becomes so much easier.  To get a great looking lawn its important to ensure that nutrients can reach the soil beneath your grass.  Aeration is important for a healthy lawn because it allows the air and water to get underneath the built up grass and thatch layer.

What is Aeration? It involves using a machine to perforate the soil with small holes to allow air, water and nutrients to get to the grass roots.  This allows the grass roots to grow deeper and will produce a stronger and more vigorous lawn.  

The key thing is does does is help alleviate against soil compaction.  If you have compacted soil then it will have too many solid particles in a certain volume space, which prevents proper circulation of air, water and nutrients within the soil.   We like to aerate our lawns at least once a year.

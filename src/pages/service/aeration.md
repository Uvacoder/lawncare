Aeration is key to what we do.  If we look after the soil then the rest becomes so much easier.  To get a great looking lawn its important to ensure that nutrients can reach the soil beneath your grass.  Aeration is important for a healthy lawn because it allows the air and water to get underneath the built up grass and thatch layer.

- What is Aeration? 

It involves using a machine to perforate the soil with small holes to allow air, water and nutrients to get to the grass roots.  This allows the grass roots to grow deeper and will produce a stronger and more vigorous lawn.  

The aerator alleviates the issues caused by soil compaction.  Compacted soil has too many solid particles in a certain volume space, preventing proper circulation of air, water and nutrients within the soil.   We like to aerate our lawns at least once a year.

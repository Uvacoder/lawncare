* **Summer (May to August)**\
  May to August  With the growing season now underway we use a slow release fertiliser that will last 10 to 12 weeks which will keep your lawn looking its best.  We then target any weeds using a different herbicide.  We tend to spot spray for weeds this time of the year so we reduce how much herbicide we are using.

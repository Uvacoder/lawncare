* **Spring  (March - April)**
  Spring is the time whenwe wake the lawn up from its dormant stage over winter.  We put down a balanced granular fertiliser and will also give it a blanket spray of a herbicide weed killer which will rid weeds or a moss control depending on what it needs.  Its this time of the year where we may recommend having a scarification if required.

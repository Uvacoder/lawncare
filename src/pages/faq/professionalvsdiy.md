We use the highest quality products available, which are not available to the general public as they have to be applied by qualified specialists. As we devote our working lives to lawn care, we buy a large quanitity of these high quality products and are able to do so at a price that is significantly lower than the proprietary products are available from garden centres. The feeds available to the general public only last for 3 - 4 weeks, whereas our fertilisers will be effective for 10 â€“ 13 weeks and as they are applied by a professional, they will not scorch your grass. 

Due to the high price that is charged to the general public for less effective fertilisers, the DIY approach to lawn care, is typically more expenisive than our professional service.

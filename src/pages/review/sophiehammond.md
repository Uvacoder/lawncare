"Having a mix of older and newer seeded grass in our garden, we started having lawn treatments from Jon last year. We wanted to maintain the older lawn and help the newer grass thrive, and we’ve definitely noticed the difference since Jon’s been treating it. Despite a very wet winter, the lawn is holding up nicely and looking healthy. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Lawns Matter to anyone who wants to get the best out of their lawn but doesn’t have the time or expertise. The service is thorough, reasonably priced and Jon is happy to advise/ explain the benefits of particular treatments. You get a helpful reminder of when a treatment is due, and Jon is always punctual and friendly."

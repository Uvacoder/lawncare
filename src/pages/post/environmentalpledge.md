Our Environmental Pledge

- We only use pesticides when required, when an assessment identifies that they are required to address an infestation, not as part of our regular annual lawn care programme.
- Many of our fertilisers are semi or fully organic
- we specialise in mechanical treatments to improve your lawn
- We do not use high nitrogen fertilisers
- We recycle the waste taken from scarification.
- We only spot treat weeds where possible to reduce the amount of herbicides used
